### Hello, I'm Aditya - The Web3 Curious Dev.

#### About Me

A Front-End developer who's totally proficient in all things Web3. Or, well, at least I pretend to be. I spend most of my time googling Web3 terms and pretending to know what I'm talking about.

Well, I'm a pro at getting divs to align perfectly, but when it comes to Web3, I'm still in the "confused" phase. Progress, right? React is my jam! I can build beautiful Web Applications that will make you go, "Wow!" But don't ask me about Web3 integration just yet. We'll get there, eventually. Maybe.

#### Currently Exploring

I'm currently on a mission to understand Web3 and everything it entails. Smart contracts, Blockchain, DApps... the whole shebang! Join me on this wild ride, where we'll both pretend to know what we're doing!

#### Need Some Fun Facts?

- I own a magic 8-ball for all my decision-making needs. The accuracy? About 10%.
- My code has a sixth sense for finding hidden bugs. It's an invaluable talent, really.
- I've been known to talk to rubber ducks during debugging sessions. They're fantastic listeners.
